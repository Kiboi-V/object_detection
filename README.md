Aerial image detection model based on YOLOv8-s, which
can accurately detect aerial image targets  under the premise of satisfying
the deployment of edge devices. This version of YOLO (yolov8) is an improved model
from ultralytics and has better accuracies than its predecessors and its latest version
can perform detection on Oriented Bounding Box (OBB) as opposed using Horizontal Bounding Box.
